    The heuristic function based on the idea of Manhattan distance.
    Instead of go horizontally and vertically, we go along diagonal lines if possible.
    The cost of the diagonal move is 1.5 weighted.
    In details, we go straight until we find a diagonal line to go directly to the goal.
    It is optimistic, ignores the crime areas and assumes that we can get to the end point with the shortest path.
